# Tech City Ventures tech test

The aim of the task was to create a simple web application demonstrating
proficiency in JavaScript, React, Express.js, Mongodb etc.

I have created a simple Todo list application in order to demonstrate my
aptitude in these areas.

The codebase is split up into a backend and a frontend which can be found in
separate directories in the project.

## Running the todo list web app.
The project is completely containerised using docker and can be easily started
by running `docker-compose up` from the root directory. You will need to
install `docker-compose` if you have not already. The web app can then be
accessed at `localhost:5000`.

The containers will have to be built the first time that they are started. This
could take up to five minutes while the necessary packages are installed.

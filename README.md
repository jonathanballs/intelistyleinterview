# Intelistyle Tech Test

The aim of this exercise was to build a simple garment search app in React using
data provided by Intelistyle.

## Running the garment search web app.
The project is completely containerised using docker and can be easily started
by running `docker-compose up` from the root directory. You will need to
install `docker-compose` if you have not already. The web app can then be
accessed at `localhost:5000`.

The containers will have to be built the first time that they are started. This
could take up to five minutes while the necessary packages are installed.
